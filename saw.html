                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-2"><strong>About Saw Palmetto Herb</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Saw Palmetto herbs have been selected as among the valuable ingredient in Kofi 29 because of its direct benefits to the hormone within the reproductive (sexual) gland.
<br>
<br>Saw Palmetto fan palm or passionately called as “Serenoa Repens” is a small sized palm and mostly found among the coastal dunes, sand hills and pinelands of the south-eastern states of the US, from South Carolina to Florida, and west to Louisiana, as well as in southern California.
<br>
<br>Due to its resilient characteristic (needs no fertilizer, resistant to insect, drought and fire resistant), the plant is often regarded as popular garden plant. The herbal benefits which are enormous is found in the berry (deep purple in color) for which 87% of the berry is composed of water, which reduces to about 7.5% when the fruit is air-dried.
<br>
<br>Natives Americans and European settlers in North America, has for century used Saw Palmetto berries to treat disorders of the genitourinary and reproductive systems. It was especially recognized as a remedy for treating inflammation of the prostrate and atrophy of the testes which generally causes impotence and low libido in men.
<br>
<br>Whilst providing solution to men, the Natives Americans also believe that Saw Palmetto is able to address woman issues, such as, taken to alleviate painful periods, infertility, stimulate the growth of under-developed breasts and to increase the amount of milk produced by nursing mothers.
<br>
<br>Recent scientific research on the herbal contribution of Saw Palmetto had supported what has been claimed by Native Americans practice. In this respect, Felter and Lloyd, for example, in their influential revision of King’s American Dispensatory in 1898, referred to Saw Palmetto as ‘the old man’s friend’ and clearly supported its’ use in relieving symptoms associated with an enlarged prostrate, saying it could help treat irritation of the prostrate, painful urination and dribbling of urine.
<br>
<br>According to an herbal specialist, Michael Castleman, men after the age of 40 will experience declining testosterone level while other hormones, especially prolactin will increase. This occurrence will result elevation of the male sex hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is responsible for the overgrowth of prostate tissue that is characteristic of Benign Prostatitis Hyperplasia (BPH).
<br>
<br>Saw Palmetto herbs help to achieve a healthy prostate that enhance urinary &amp; sexual health. The prostate plays a key role in men’s sexuality, providing more than 90 percent of his ejaculate, including semen, the enzyme-filled fluid required for the fertilization of the ovum. The walnut-sized prostate gland produces most of the fluid in semen. Contraction of the muscles in the prostate squeezes fluid from the prostate into the urethral tract during ejaculation. Fluid from the prostate makes up the bulk of ejaculate, and nourishes and transports the sperm.
<br>
<br>Saw Palmetto herbs is found to possess high proportion of fatty acids and “sterols” (stop the conversion process of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT)which is responsible for the multiplication of prostate cells bringing about baldness in men.)
<br>
<br>To sum up Saw Palmetto’s actions, it:
<br>
<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Inhibits the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Protects the prostate cells from harmful DHT.
<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops estrogen’s effects on the prostate.
<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Reduces the action of growth factors that encourage prostate tissue to enlarge.<br>
<br>It is reported that synthetic drugs, “Finasteride” for the treatment of BPH are apt to have “some disturbing side effects, among them decreased libido, ejaculatory problems and erection loss.” However, Saw Palmetto herbs was just as effective as the standard drug, “Finasteride”, in relieving the symptoms of moderate BPH, with fewer side effects and for that in Germany and Austria, it is commonly a first choice when treating BPH.
<br>
<br>Saw Palmetto herbs performed as hormone tonic to supports the organs of the endocrine system, including the adrenals, thyroid, ovaries and pancreas. The herb is a prime nutrient and stimulant of the reproductive system, reputedly with progestogenic, estrogenic and testosterone-like actions. Favored as remedy to treat weakening urinary organs and the resulting incontinence that may occur in elderly people or women after menopause, it is also an alternative in relieving premenstrual ­syndrome (PMS) that include menstrual cramps, bloating, heaviness or pressure in the pelvic area, and headaches. The herbs is also capable (in a limited way) of normalizing the function and size of reproductive organs; for instance, they can help reduce an enlarged prostate and can rebuild vaginal tissue as well as increase the size of women’s breasts.</p>
